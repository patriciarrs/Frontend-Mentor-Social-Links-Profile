## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS media queries

### What I learned

#### Mobile-first workflow

Mobile-first design is an approach to designing UIs that prioritizes small-screen experience.

---

#### CSS media queries

I used media queries to handle cases where I needed to apply CSS styles depending on screen resolution.
Example:

```css
@media (min-width: 769px) {
  .card {
    max-width: 38.4rem;
  }
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Using media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries) - This helped me remember the correct syntax for writing media queries.
